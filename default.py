"""service.chronicle.scrobbler — Script entry point.

Launching the addon from Kodi's Add-on browser goes straight to Settings --
per-user correction (2026-08-29): "I only ever want them to open the regular
settings window, not whatever [the old action-list menu] is." The other
actions this used to offer as a Dialog().select() menu (Sync Watch History &
Ratings Now, Reset TV/Movie Progress, Test Connection, Sync Lists to Kodi)
are still reachable -- each now has its own action button inside the
relevant Settings category, using the same RunScript(...,action=...)
mechanism Edit Connection/Change Chronicle URL already used.

    successful connection was still saved, even while chronicle_url sat empty
    and every actual Connect attempt was failing outright. Confirmed live
    (2026-08-27, sibling Chronicle_Scraper addons): status showed "Connected"
    immediately after a Connect attempt that never got past "URL not set."

    When configured, also fetches the connected identity (GET /users/me,
    5s-bounded -- see ChronicleClient.get_current_user()'s own docstring for
    why this can't be allowed to make menu-opening feel stuck) so the status
    reads "Connected as {name}" instead of a bare "Connected" -- per-user
    request (2026-08-28): know WHO is connected before doing anything else,
    not just whether a key happens to be saved. A saved key that's actually
    been revoked server-side surfaces here too (the lookup fails, falling
    back to the last-known name -- see below -- rather than silently keeping
    a stale "Connected").

    connected_display_name (hidden setting) caches the last successful
    lookup so a transient network blip doesn't regress an already-known name

    """"Edit Connection" -- launches the QR device-auth flow to obtain an API key.

    Prompts for the Chronicle URL directly, via a reliable modal dialog, but
    ONLY when there isn't already a saved one. Settings' own chronicle_url
    text field is READ-ONLY (enable="false" in resources/settings.xml) and no
    longer trusted for entry at all: Kodi's on-screen-keyboard edit to that
    field was confirmed live (2026-08-27, sibling Chronicle_Scraper addons)
    to not reliably land in the underlying setting, even after the whole
    Settings dialog was fully closed -- not a timing issue, an
    entry-not-committing one, upstream of anything this addon controls.
    Rather than fight that control (and risk the user retyping the same URL
    twice, once in Settings and again in a fallback prompt), this is now the
    ONE place the URL is ever entered. An already-connected reconnect
    (chronicle_url already set) skips the prompt entirely and goes straight
    to the QR window: a working URL is never asked for twice.

    Passes the resolved URL directly into DeviceAuthManager rather than
    letting it re-read chronicle_url from settings itself. Confirmed live
    against the sibling Chronicle_Scraper addons (2026-08-27): a DIFFERENT
    xbmcaddon.Addon() instance's own getSetting() call -- device_auth.py's
    own module-level ADDON, not this one -- did NOT see the setSetting() this
    function had just done, even one line earlier in the same process.
    Handing the value over directly sidesteps that cross-instance
    consistency question entirely.
