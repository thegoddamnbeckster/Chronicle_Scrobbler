"""Resolves a human-meaningful name for this Kodi instance.

Shared by device_auth.py (device-auth pairing request) and media_info.py
(every scrobble payload) so a scrobble's deviceName column in Chronicle's
history/reports actually identifies which box played it (e.g. "Vision" or
a DNS name) instead of the literal, useless "Kodi" every installation used
to send -- indistinguishable from any other Kodi instance scrobbling to the
same Chronicle account.

    """Prefer the machine's actual DNS name over Kodi's own FriendlyName setting --
    FriendlyName is just an arbitrary label the user can set to anything, while a
    real DNS name is a verifiable identifier for the physical device.

    socket.getfqdn() tries a genuine reverse-DNS/hosts lookup and upgrades to a
    dotted name when that succeeds, but on a typical home LAN there's usually no
    such record -- it then falls back to the plain OS hostname, which is still a
    real, meaningful identifier (often mDNS-resolvable as "<hostname>.local") and
    clearly better than an arbitrary Kodi settings label. Only the degenerate
    "localhost" non-answer is treated as "no usable name".

    Confirmed live (2026-08-28, Shield Android TV box): BOTH socket calls come
    back unusable there -- Android's sandboxed network stack doesn't expose a
    real hostname/FQDN to Python the way desktop OSes do -- so this used to fall
    straight through to 'Kodi — {FriendlyName}', and since FriendlyName itself
    defaults to the literal string "Kodi" until a user explicitly customizes it
    (Settings -> Services -> Control -> Device Name), the Now Playing banner
    showed the genuinely useless "Kodi — Kodi" on every un-customized install --
    indistinguishable from the original bug this function was written to fix.
    Per-user spec (2026-08-28): "try to use the device friendly name, like
    Downstairs Shield. failing that's try Kodi's friendly name. if it's Kodi,
    use the IP address of the device." Four tiers, in order:
      1. socket.getfqdn() / socket.gethostname() -- the device's own network-
         level identity (what "device friendly name" means here: NOT Kodi's
         own setting, the actual machine).
      2. System.FriendlyName -- Kodi's own configurable label, but ONLY when
         it's a real customization, not the literal unmodified default "Kodi".
      3. Network.IPAddress -- always available on any device with a live
         network connection, and at minimum distinguishes multiple
         un-customized Kodi instances from each other on the Now Playing
         banner (e.g. "10.0.0.161" vs "10.0.0.162"), unlike a generic
         "Kodi (unnamed device)" placeholder every un-named install would
         send identically.
      4. Bare "Kodi" -- only if literally nothing above produced anything
         (no network interface up at all); should be unreachable in practice.
